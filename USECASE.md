Mass configure Umbrella Secure Internet Gateway on routers
=====================================
This project configures Umbrella Secure Internet Gateway (SIG) on remote
network devices. Customers can quickly provision large, distributed networks
and perform automated key rollovers to integrate with SIG. The solution is
particularly useful for disaster response/humanitarian operations, but can be
used for any use case in which it is well-suited.
